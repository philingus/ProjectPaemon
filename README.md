## 🌈 About Project Pæmon

Welcome to **Project Pæmon**, a Pokémon-inspired experience that curates a unique companion—your very own Pæmon! This project is a collaborative labor of love by four developers from around the world:

- **Phil** 🖥️ [https://www.linkedin.com/in/philhocombatir/](#)
- **Sama** 💡 [https://www.linkedin.com/in/noorul-sama-sahel-975586246/](#)
- **Hannah** 🎨 [https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannaherauch/ ](#)
- **Chan** 🛠️ [https://www.linkedin.com/in/chan-dinh/](#)

Despite different time zones, backgrounds, and skill sets, we came together to create a playful, AI-powered project that celebrates individuality. **Project Pæmon** takes your unique qualities and username, analyzes them through an engaging questionnaire, and generates a one-of-a-kind Pæmon just for you.
